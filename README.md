# OOP-project

I made this project in my first year as part of my academic Object Oriented Programing course, This project is a competition application using MVC design pattern and javafx for the frontend.
You can add contestants manullay or generate them automatically, choose a sport you want them to compete in, and then arrange the score according to the IRL results of the matches. (manually adding results) untill you have a winner.
